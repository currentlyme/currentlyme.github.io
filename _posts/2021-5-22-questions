The one who askes, leads. 

There are two scenarios worth considering:
- Posing questions strategically and with authenticity. 
- Posing questions because your inner child cant stand awkward silence, it feels icky to see the other person uncomfortable looking for things to say, or thinking "I have always been this nervous, scattered girl. I am not worthy to be selfish and in charge."

Depending on which one you play out, it will either bring you respect and awe or you may earn some sympathy but primarly distrust, dissmisal and discreet dislike.


p.s. in charge doesnt need to mean bossy. In charge can happen at the same time as non judgement.
