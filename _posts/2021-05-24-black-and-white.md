Many people and expescially people who are traumatized expereince black adn white thinking. Either you are perfect or you are not. Either you like the music or you hate it. 
Ofte there is nothing inbetween. Either you like a person or you dislike them. Either you are really good in it or you suck.

Havinge experienced a traumatizing situation makes you want to control everything. To never be in such a helpless, overwhelming situation again. 
In your need to control you pit things into boxes - quickly. And the easiest way to do that is to have a box on each side of the extrem.

When trauma passes you realize life is a contionuum. You can be really good and still suck at times. You can be loving and kind and sometimes an asshole.
