Black and white thinking: Either you like the music or you hate it. Either you are really good in sth or you simply suck. Either you vibe with a person or they dislike them. 
With black and white thinking there is nothing inbetween. 

Black and white thinking helps to judge fast, to make decisions fast. It gives you a sense of control, it makes you feel safe. 
But you, life, relationships or anything really does not exist inbetween two poles. Its a continuom. You can be really good and still suck at times. You can be loving and kind and sometimes an asshole. You can be loved for being you and still disliked for coming too late. And you can even be mediocre and still good enough.
