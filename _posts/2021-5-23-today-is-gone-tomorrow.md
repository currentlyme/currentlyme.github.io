today is gone tomorrow

We have days of instense emotional distress (giving a presentation or having a stressfull deadline) and the day after everything seems less dramatic. 

And there are days where we have moments of wonder and joy, which might already be forgotten the next day. 

Feelings change, hold on to joy in the moment and Don't take stress too seriously.
