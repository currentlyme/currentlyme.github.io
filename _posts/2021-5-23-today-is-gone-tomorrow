today is gone tomorrow

We have days of instense emotional distress (giving a presentation or having a stressfull deadline) and the day after everything seems less dramatic. 

And there are days where we have moments of great joy, which might already be forgotten the next day. 

Becuase feelings change, we should hold on to joy in the moment and don't take stress too seriously.
